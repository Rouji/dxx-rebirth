/* This header serves several purposes:
 * - Declare namespace dcx and add it to the list of searched
 *   namespaces.
 * - If the compiler can disambiguate a namespace from a class inside a
 *   searched namespace[1], declare dummy classes scoped so that
 *   attempting to nest a namespace incorrectly causes a redefinition
 *   error.  The build would usually fail even without this forced
 *   check, but the redefinition error forces a clear and immediate
 *   report.
 *
 * If building game-specific code:
 * - #define dsx to a game-specific namespace: d1x or d2x, as
 *   appropriate.
 * - Declare namespace dsx and add it to the list of searched
 *   namespaces.  When the dsx migration is finished, this `using
 *   namespace` statement will be removed.
 * Otherwise:
 * - Declare dummy class dsx to force a redefinition error on attempts
 *   to declare `namespace dsx` in common-only code.
 *
 * [1] gcc handles this in all tested versions.  There are no known
 *	clang versions which handle this.  See the SConstruct test for
 *	DXX_HAVE_CXX_DISAMBIGUATE_USING_NAMESPACE for how this is detected.
